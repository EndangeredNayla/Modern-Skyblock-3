Release 3.6.0:
Many things have been changed with a lot of contribution from Psylin, though general changes include:
- Updated a lot of mods
- Changed the main menu
- Removed the custom islands (since they don't really work properly anymore)
- Re-organized all the quest pages
- Removed the exploration mods (nobody liked the GalactiCraft part and The Twilight Forest was too late in progression for it not to be finishable in an hour) !Make sure to not be any of those dimensions when updating!
- Fixed many quests
- Removed the extremely difficult Chaotic Core recipe
